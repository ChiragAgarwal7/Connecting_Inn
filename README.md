# Connecting Inn

A flutter app for organizing your contact list and connection channels.

Working professionals generally exchange cards as a means for exchanging connections, but this process has a lot of flaws and cannot really be optimised. People even tend to loose all the cards and phone numbers. Connecting Inn is made precisely for tackling this kinds of problems. It helps you make a chain of contacts and perform querry search by different tags you place on the contact. Though there are several social media for this none focuses on the private connections of a person thus making the actual connections weak. Connecting Inn not only lets you make a private chain but also helps you check out others if the said person authorizes the check.
